  <h2>How he came of his Stand</h2>
  <p>
    Squeen Ness gained his power after his ancestor Grug Ness activated his stand ability
    when Squeen Ness was 18. Every Squeenstar from then has gained the ability to manifest a stand.
  </p>

  <aside><h2>His Stand</h2>
  <p>At the end of Part 3, when his predecessor defeated Ey Boss, Squeen Ness awakened his stand in the heat of battle. This battle ended him up in a temporary prison cell, where he was met by others. The others told him that Grug Ness inhereted many Stand Arrows and gained the power to Silence his enemies via "Grug Plug". He then gave the rest when he retired from fighting to his sons, where it was passed down to Squeen Ness. He then activated his stand. His powers consist of:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Jazz Manipulation</li>
  <li>Music Warpation</li>
  <li>Pointless</li>  
  </ul></aside>
  

<p>These powers are very special in his universe, as he can warp sounds, change the themes of areas, and make things feel useless to do.</p>
